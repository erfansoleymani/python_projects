# GitHub Repository for Python for Everybody Specialization  

## **Introduction**  
This GitHub repository is dedicated to the **Python for Everybody Specialization**, a five-course series that introduces fundamental programming concepts using the Python programming language. The repository contains code implementations, assignments, and projects completed throughout the specialization, covering topics such as data structures, networked application programming interfaces (APIs), and databases.  

## **Skills Covered**  
The specialization equips learners with various programming and analytical skills, including:  

- **Python Programming:** Writing efficient and structured Python code  
- **Computer Programming & Software Engineering:** Understanding core programming principles  
- **Data Structures:** Lists, dictionaries, tuples, and file handling in Python  
- **Algorithms:** Implementing logic to solve computational problems  
- **Databases & SQL:** Working with databases using SQLite and executing SQL queries  
- **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Processing, analyzing, and visualizing data using Python libraries  
- **Networked Applications & APIs:** Interacting with web services and extracting data from APIs  
- **Problem Solving & Critical Thinking:** Developing logical solutions for computational tasks  

## **Specialization Overview**  
This specialization builds upon the **Python for Everybody course** and is designed for beginners who want to learn programming from scratch. It consists of five courses:  

1. **Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)**  
   - Introduction to Python  
   - Variables, expressions, and conditional statements  
2. **Python Data Structures**  
   - Lists, dictionaries, tuples  
   - File handling and string manipulation  
3. **Using Python to Access Web Data**  
   - Web scraping with Python  
   - Working with APIs and retrieving data  
4. **Using Databases with Python**  
   - SQL and SQLite database integration  
   - Data storage and retrieval  
5. **Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data**  
   - Designing and developing a real-world data processing application  

## **Applied Learning Project**  
At the end of the specialization, students complete a **capstone project** where they develop a Python application for **data retrieval, processing, and visualization**. This project integrates all learned concepts, including APIs, databases, and Python programming.  

## **Repository Structure**  
The repository is organized into directories based on the courses and projects:  
- `/course1-intro-python/` → Basic Python programming exercises  
- `/course2-data-structures/` → Lists, dictionaries, and file handling  
- `/course3-web-data/` → Web scraping and API interactions  
- `/course4-databases/` → SQL and database-related projects  
- `/capstone-project/` → Final project integrating all learned skills  

## **Conclusion**  
This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for learning **Python programming** through the **Python for Everybody Specialization**. It includes well-documented code, assignments, and projects that demonstrate practical applications of Python in real-world scenarios.
